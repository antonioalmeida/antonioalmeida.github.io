I'm a Software Engineer (MSc 2020) from Portugal based in Berlin, currently at [Klarna](https://klarna.com) working on consumer banking products. I used to play professional [handball](https://www.zerozero.pt/news.php?id=276863) in Portugal's first division. 

I enjoy playing with new technologies and [expect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#Applications_and_criticisms) (someday) to make useful software in the meantime. Automating sucker, also interested in Music Software, AI, and InfoSec enthusiast.
