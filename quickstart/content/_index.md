My name is Ant√≥nio Almeida and I'm a fifth (and final year) Computer Engineering Student at [FEUP](https://fe.up.pt), currently interning as Junior BA at [LTPLabs](https://ltplabs.com/). I also play professional [handball](https://www.zerozero.pt/news.php?id=276863) in Portugal's first division. 

My goal in life is to create meaningful software. And let's be honest, dabbling with new technology is also fun. Interested in AI, Data Science/Engineering, and Music Software. Previously worked as _Research Assistant_ at [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en) and as _Teaching Assistant_ at FEUP for courses on Computer Graphics and Low-level Device Drivers.
