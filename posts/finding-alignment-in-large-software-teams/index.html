The team has diverse backgrounds, levels of experience, and, naturally, different opinions shaped by past experiences.</p><p>The work being done in parallel can be overwhelming for any one person to keep track of. As you review someone&rsquo;s work, like a pull request, you may think:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;This should be unit tested, not integration tested.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t duplicate the behavior of X in Y.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;This PR lacks context; we need a more detailed description of the solution and its trade-offs.&rdquo;</li><li><code>&lt;Insert your engineering dogma here...></code></li></ul><p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we talk about this?&rdquo; you wonder. Maybe you did but not with everyone present. Or it was too long ago for newer team members to know. Maybe you <em>meant</em> to write an RFC about it but never got to.</p><p>In a perfect world, any technical problem is refined, decided upon, and the outcome is instantly embedded into the team&rsquo;s ways of working, and enforced automatically via tooling.</p><p>Real life is more complex. Achieving alignment on quality standards, engineering practices, and architectural decisions is tough when everyone is stretched thin, and the communication overhead in a 10-person team is no joke.</p><p>How do you address this in a way that solves short term problem (i.e., <em>this</em> open PR), while benefiting the team long-term in a way that&rsquo;s healthy for everyone?</p><p>In my limited but immersive experience in large teams I&rsquo;ve identified some typical patterns of how people<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> approach this:</p><h2 id=ill-fix-it-myself>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix it myself&rdquo;</h2><p>Don&rsquo;t do this. There are two key reasons for producing &ldquo;low-quality work&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>:</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of skill</strong>: people don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re doing (yet).</li><li><strong>Lack of ownership</strong>: people do know what to do but don&rsquo;t care enough to do it properly.</li></ol><p>Either way, taking over doesn&rsquo;t help in the long run. If you step in:</p><ol><li>They won&rsquo;t learn, and the same issue will arise next time.<ul><li>Instead, consider pairing with them.</li></ul></li><li>People feel more ownership if they influence the decisions affecting their work. By taking over, nothing changes.<ul><li>Even allowing less optimal decisions can build accountability next time. Consider a &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; approach.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=just-review-it>&ldquo;Just review it&rdquo;</h2><p>Treat this as a one-time issue. List all of your concerns explicitly, from nitpics to bugs to recommendations. Heck, even use <a href=https://conventionalcomments.org/>conventional comments</a> while you&rsquo;re are it.</p><p>Here’s what might happen:</p><ol><li><strong>Your feedback is taken at face value</strong>: You got what you wanted. The work is now following your ideas and standards. But what about next time? There&rsquo;s a chance this wasn&rsquo;t the learning experience you envisioned because the underlying principles weren&rsquo;t discussed. It&rsquo;s a short term win but gamble in the future.</li><li><strong>Key feedback is constructively challenged</strong>: This is good. However, this is likely an indication that you&rsquo;re dealing with a healthy team and this is a non-issue. Even in this scenario, there&rsquo;s a chance that not everyone followed along (and you can&rsquo;t blame them, there&rsquo;s <em>so much</em> to do).</li><li><strong>Feedback is ignored</strong>: Time for reflection. Are you missing context? Is there a deadline you&rsquo;re not aware of? Is the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; a team agreement or just in your head? Are you <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> or <em><a href=https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/04/21/dont-let-architecture-astronauts-scare-you/>austronauting</a></em>?</li></ol><h2 id=focus-on-what-matters-most>&ldquo;Focus on What Matters Most&rdquo;</h2><p>Use the scenario to build alignment for future issues. Prioritize one or two critical issues at most. Logs don&rsquo;t follow the standard? Who cares&mldr; (right now)? Is there a misalignment on what &ldquo;idempotency&rdquo; means? Time to solve this for good.</p><p>Explain <em>why</em> it&rsquo;s important. Explore alternatives and detail trade-offs, referencing authoritative sources (company guidelines, perhaps) but be critical of them. Finish with your recommendation.</p><p>Here are some things that I&rsquo;ve seen help ease this process:</p><ul><li><strong>Find a Common Language</strong>: terms like &ldquo;scalable&rdquo; mean different things for the 20 year veteran who writes compilers for fun versus the junior engineer who just graduated. And it&rsquo;s not a given who&rsquo;s right&mldr;</li><li><strong>Align on Fundamentals</strong>: you can&rsquo;t discuss multi region deployments in a room where people don&rsquo;t agree on the difference between a unit test and an integration test.</li><li><strong>Include Everyone in Discussions</strong>: remember the accountability thing?</li><li><strong>Define Your Assumptions</strong>: building software is hard. You design with failure in mind. But you need to stop somewhere. Find <strong>reasonable</strong> assumptions depending on your requirements which help you avoid the &ldquo;but what if X fails?&rdquo; loop. <sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></li><li><strong>Repeat Yourself</strong>: if you feel misunderstood, you&rsquo;re probably right. Simplify your message. Speaking aloud often highlights reasoning issues.</li><li><strong>&ldquo;No stupid questions&rdquo;</strong>: if you&rsquo;re not following along, changes are others aren&rsquo;t either.</li></ul><h2 id=it-gets-better-with-time>It gets better with time</h2><p>You won&rsquo;t solve everything in a day (or a month). Maybe in a year or two. But it will get better if you focus on the most important problems, and work at it as a team.</p><p>It&rsquo;s joyous to work in a high trust, cohesive software team that delivers quality software.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll know it when you get there.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Mostly Individual Contributors.
